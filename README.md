# React.js + DaisyUI Memory Card Game

- Deployed on Vercel, this is a simple memory game that shows off how useEffect can be used to synchronize asynchronous actions, like fetching from the PokeAPI.
- This game randomly picks 10 Gen V (White/Black) Pokemon, and the goal is to click on each pokemon only once. The cards are shuffled after each click.
- This project utilizes the TailwindCSS component library DaisyUI. DaisyUI makes it easy to change themes and quickly make functional (and sexy) components quickly.
- This project also utilizes cheap npm libraries like react-card-flip and react-parallax-tilt. Take a wild guess as to what those libraries do.

- I could've done more, like adding difficulty (amount of cards) or allowing the user to choose what generations of Pokemon to choose from, but I have demonstrated the project's lesson of useEffect, so I'm moving on.
